We're dealing with equations for just one component
(i.e. one of R, G, B) at a time, since each component
is independent of others.
But there's a constraint, the Alpha value calculated
by solving each of the three components should match.
Otherwise, we can conclude that the equation doesn't
hold true.

Let's attempt to solve for H and A, WITHOUT knowing
the value of B.

b = background component
h = highlight component
a = highlight alpha
R = result component

(1-a)*b + a*h = R
b + ah - ab = R
(1-a)b + ah = R
(1-a)b - (1-a-1)h = R
(1-a)b - (1-a)h - h = R
(1-a)(b - h) - h = R

(1-a)*b + a*h = R
b = (R - ah)/(1-a)
